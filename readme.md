# GFX Lib

# Overview
This is designed partly as a learning exercise to learn different graphics apis, but also as a useful library you 
can plug into a project to be able to easily render things to the screen (much like a canvas in HTML). It also aims 
to hopefully provide a somewhat standardised interface across all the apis. 

Currently, the aim is to try to get to the 3 main apis:
- OpenGL
- Vulkan
- DirectX

In reality the first one will be OpenGL and then Vulkan and finally DirectX but the development of these may overlap somewhat.
